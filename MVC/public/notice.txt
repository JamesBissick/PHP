Changer root directory (ctrl+f = root)


## Each Class in a separate file
Not required, but has advantages
    - Easier to find a specific Class in your code --> easier to maintain
    - Can load the Class files automatically


## Require or include?
To use the class, we need to load the file it's in:
    include, if file not find will carry on
    require, if file not find, will stop the code and produce an error
